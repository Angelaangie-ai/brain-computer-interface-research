# Brain Computer Interface Research

Applications of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have grown in importance for assisting individuals with sever motor disabilities to navigate 
our increasingly technologically dependent society. With applications including electric wheelchairs and advanced prosthetics in mind, the goal of this 
research is to develop a system that enables the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals to control the movement of a
robot. 

An EEG cap was used to obtain occipital alpha power density, frontal muscular artifacts, and sensorimotor mu rhythms to send back to a PC via Bluetooth for further pro-
cessing. Signal-processing algorithms were developed and implemented in order to determine the userâ€™s mental activity. While the implementation with a physical robot has yet to be
completed, simulation data demonstrates promising results for future real-time asynchronous control of physical devices.

I focused to classify motor imagery data through common spatial pattern filters and classification of tasks by a random forest predictive algorithm.
